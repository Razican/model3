# Tesla Model 3 configurator

This small website can help you decide on your Tesla Model 3 configuration. It has prices in USD ($)
and EUR (â‚¬), and it also brings options such as double motors and performance mode, with tentative
prices. You can also configure the taxes and the incentives. The financing is still not available.
The program is in English and in Spanish.
